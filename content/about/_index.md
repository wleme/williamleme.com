Hello! I'm a Head of Software Engineering at a legal tech based in sunny Jacksonville, Florida, USA. 

I bring technical vision,  strategy and execution to the table, leading engineering teams to move products, processes, and architecture forward. 

Iâ€™m all about pragmatic engineering, delivering quality and value, building strong teams, and promoting a growth mindset across both individuals and organizations. My focus is on driving meaningful outcomes for companies while keeping customers at the center.
