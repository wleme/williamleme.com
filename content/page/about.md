Software Engineer Manager | Full Stack Dev | Cloud Platform Services

Hello! I'm William Leme, a head of software development with a strong business mind based in sunny Jacksonville, Florida / USA. I'm all about adding value to software products, automating processes, promoting a growth mindset within businesses and creating strong teams.

Between my daily job and [wllapps.com](/my-apps/) I do lots of .net core and nodejs, among other things (front end / back end / devops / QA).

If you want to reach out you can send an email to: **__contact at williamleme dot com__** or find me on the channels bellow.
